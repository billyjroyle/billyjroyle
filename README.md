I've spent the last 5 years in the serviced office and co-working industry 🏢 and the 5 years before that in hospitality 🍕. I have since departed these indutries to persue a life of data analytics 📊; finding answers amongst the questions,  delivering insights amonst the ambiguity and bringing order to the chaos!

🌱 I’m currently learning:
* Python
* SQL
* Data Science
* Vizualization Tools
* and git!

👨‍🎓 I have also used the following resources to fuel my learning journey:
* YouTube
* Sololearn (on the go!)
* Codecademy
* Coursera
