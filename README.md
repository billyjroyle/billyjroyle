### Hello (GitHub) World! 👋

#### My name is _**Billy**_, welcome to my GitHub page. 

I am an aspiring Data Scientist currently studying on a bootcamp provided by [CoGrammer.](https://skills.cogrammar.com/) 

![CoGrammer Logo](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tpd/logos/65547063d19d86de99ead42f/0x0.png)

I've spent the last 5 years in the serviced office and co-working industry 🏢 and the 5 years before that in hospitality 🍕. I have since departed these industries to persue a life of data analytics 📊; finding answers amongst the questions,  delivering insights amongst the ambiguity and bringing order to the chaos!

🌱 I’m currently learning:
* Python
* SQL
* Data Science
* Visualization Tools
* and git!

👨‍🎓 I have also used the following resources to fuel my learning journey:
* YouTube
* Sololearn (on the go!)
* Codecademy
* Coursera

If you're looking for a beginner to collaborate with 😍 or even work with 😎 I'm you're guy - connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billy-r-43a4427a/)
